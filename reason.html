        <h2>We've known each other</h2>
        <p>
          I know we went two and half years without talking but when we started talking again, it was like nothing ever happened. It’s like we watched each other grow without actually being there. The way we talk about how we used to be when we were younger and laugh about it. The way we remember the negatives and the positives. You've become my best friend (Don't tell Kyle) and I want to be there to watch your growth this time. Let’s grow together.

        <h2>You care for me</h2>
        <p>
          I know this could be something you can get from any friend but the way you care about me, what I like, what I don’t like. You literally accompanied me to the hospital when I was injured. That warmed my heart so much and I thought “This is someone I can’t live without”

        <h2>You take God seriously</h2>
        <p>
          This is something I believe everyone should do but I love the way you take your relationship with God seriously. You’re just the person to talk to about God, anything spiritual and I think you’re a person I can open up to about my struggles and I give the same opportunity to you. Also, if you say Yes to this then we can pray together lol

        <h2>You don't act perfect</h2>
        <p>
          Okay fine, you’re perfect in my eyes.<br>But I love the way you’re self-aware. It means you can accept when you’re wrong and see the other person’s perspective. That’s something everyone needs in a partner and I don’t want to find it in anyone but you.

        <h2>I want to be in your life</h2>
        <p>
          Lastly, I want to be your rock. You asked me to call you when you were having a panic attack and you believed I was your safe space. I want us to grow more into that. I want to be there to support you in everything and spur you on in everything. People didn’t want you to run for senior student but I supported it because I could see your passion for leading. That spark in your eye is something I will never get tired of seeing.
